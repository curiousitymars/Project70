        <p>Madam Weatherberry's Academy of Magic (Land of Stories Series) is a school, where Madam Weatherberry teaches her very few students to practice and control their magic. Magic has been outlawed in all four kingdoms over time, and the students must prove that magic is a good thing, which can help everyone in the long run. </p>

            <p>On the first lesson, when Madam Whetherberry asks everyone to pull out their true selves with magic, she instructs them to look at their reflection in the lake and do so. On Xanthous' turn, when the flames subside, he is wearing a golden suit, which had a thin layer of fire. A trail of smoke hung off his jacket, and he wore an iron bow tie so heated up that it glowed.</p>

After multiple speculations, it is revealed that the friend she was reffering to was the Snow Queen, and that she was also talking about herself. The snow queen grew stronger as she grew weak. She wanted to create a problem that could only be solved by magic, so that humankind would understand the importance. And, she said that as long as the Northern Lights were visible, she was overpowering the Snow Queen.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The Tradition of the Righteous Brootherhood has been passed down through generations in three hundred thirty-three families in the Southern Kingdom. It always will have 333 people. Exactly 333. No less, and no more. They have high levels of secrecy, that even they don't know each other's identity. They are so feared that even high ranking members of society fear them. They were the cause of magic being outlawed in the world. In the book "A Tale of Witchcraft", they all return after five hundred years. Their goal is to keep magic outlawed. After they suceeded in their plans centuries ago, they faded into the shadows. But at the end of "A Tale of Magic", Brystal Evergreen and her friends form a council and contact the kingdoms, letting them know that magic can help people. That was when the brotherhood returned. And this time, they planned to take the Southern Kingdom's throne, from the currend king, Champion XIV.</p>
